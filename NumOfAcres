	{
		int acre = 43450; 
		double numberAcres = 312840; // Multiplied Length * Wide (869x360 ft)
    double totalAcres = numberAcres / acre;
    
  // Display Results
		cout << "In a tract of land that has " << numberAcres << " square feet ";
		cout << "there are approximately " << totalAcres << " acres in a tract of land. \n";
